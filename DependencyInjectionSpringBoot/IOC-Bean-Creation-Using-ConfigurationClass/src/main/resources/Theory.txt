Different way of creating bean:
1) @Service
2) @Component
3) @Repository
4) @RestController / @Controller
5) @Bean
---------------------------------

****Bean****
When we create bean using @Bean, we don't need to declare any Stereotype annotation.
We just need to inject the dependency using constructor/setter/field.

****RestTemplate-Configuration*****

Created new RestTemplate bean outside of spring managed bean.
This RestTemplate bean handle below feature:
    1) Connection timeout
    2) Disable cookies management
    3) added encoding to URI variables
-->
    Rest API call:
    * Followed best practice to call Rest API using RestTemplate.
    * Added headers as a part of request url where we can pass JWT token/encoded basic auth
      userId&Pass
    * Handle restTemplate Error as well to provide proper response if error occures.
