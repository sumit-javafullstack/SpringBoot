Problem Statement:
    If we have multiple instance of producer running in different port like below:
       DESKTOP-C321NIN:cst-employee-producer:8889 ,
       DESKTOP-C321NIN:cst-employee-producer:8091 ,
       DESKTOP-C321NIN:cst-employee-producer:8888
    and multiple consumer tries to read this client, to balance the node across all the instances we use
    Load Balancer.

Load Balancer:
    This follow round robbin algorithm when multiple request comes in for multiple instances.
    e.g: A->B->C->A->B->.......
This helps us to balance the load across all the instance of producer.

For example, look at the below log generated with and without load balancer:

 >>> From Client---Without Load Balancer -> producer port id : 8888
 >>> From Client---Without Load Balancer -> producer port id : 8888
 >>> From Client---Without Load Balancer -> producer port id : 8888
 >>> From Client---Without Load Balancer -> producer port id : 8888
 *****************************************************************
 >>> From Client--- Load Balancer----> producer port id : 8889
 >>> From Client--- Load Balancer----> producer port id : 8889
 >>> From Client--- Load Balancer----> producer port id : 8888
 >>> From Client--- Load Balancer----> producer port id : 8091
